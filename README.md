# Mainline Menswear Front End Technical Test

Hello and welcome to the Mainline Menswear Front End Technical Test.

This test is an opportunity to showcase your development skills as well as your attention to detail. You are welcome to develop the web application using any frontend and/or css framework of your choice. Please note though, that we develop our web applications using VueJS and NuxtJS, so please keep this in mind as you'll be using these frameworks in future if you are given a front end role.

This github repository provides all of the designs required to create the web application. So please place close attention to the designs. There is a style guide for both light and dark themes. We also used google fonts for both font styles and font awesome 5 for our icons. 

In terms of the backend, we have provided you three endpoints. Two of the three endpoints will GET the products and the product information you need to display and third endpoint will POST your enquiry using a AJAX web form. The endpoint URLs can be found below:



The table below lists all the fields needed in your form. If an example is given, it's to help you understand how we expect this returne. If no example is given, we expect that you understand how this field should be returned.

| Form Field ID| Required Format| Advice        |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------- |
| productId    | number         |               |
| sizeSelected | string         |               |
| fullname     | string         |               |
| email        | string         |               |
| competitor   | string         | yes or no     |
| competitorUrl| string         | optional      |
| enquiry      | string         |               |

Please make sure to test your submissions and look for any errors returned when building your web application.

All data that is sent to us will remain in our database for 2 weeks. We will only use this data to confirm whether you have done the test or not. No personal information provided will be passed on or shared.

## What were looking for
We're looking to see where you are currently in your development career and work out how technical you are. When attempting this test please do what you know and try not to challenge yourself too much. 

We've identified three levels to this test. If your more comfortable with just CSS and HTML, then please don't worry about the form and just create the design in the choice of your framework. If you want more of a challenge, then please add Javascript and create a form that can submit successfully. If you want to go further beyond that, then impress us with using our choice of framework and completing the whole challenge, even perhaps going beyond?

Try to impress us!

## Submission
Once you're happy with your test, please commit all your work into your own github repostitory and add **mmw-frontend** as a contributor to your repo. There must be clear instructions on how to initialise your web application if you have not used NuxtJS. 

Good luck and we look forward to seeing your tests!
